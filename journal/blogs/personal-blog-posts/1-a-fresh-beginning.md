# A Fresh Beginning

## Why I started this

So why this initiative?

I mean if you want to have your own blog, there are free options like WordPress and Blogger out there.
Why start your static website?

Basically, I want to learn about VitePress and Vue.
The VitePress website sells themselves as &lsquo;Vite & Vue Powered Static Site Generator&rsquo;

I have worked with Angular, and dabbled on React on occasion.  
But truth be told, the development experience is just not fantastic.  
Of course, developing an application is always complicating down the road.

I guess if the development experience was good, no one would have developed new frameworks such as VitePress.

I'm pretty sure no one wants to spend effort on building something that brings no value to the table.

And so I created this website.

## What will happen to your WordPress blogs?

Yeah, that's a consideration.

I intend to have both run in conjunction.

Truth be told, I'm blogging less on WordPress these days.

But at some point, what I want to do is to somehow synchronize the posts between Tech Note Press and my WordPress blogs.

Failing that, the other thing I want to do is be able to post what I write on Tech Note Press to my WordPress blog as well.

Aside: Now what would be cool is that after I wrote a statement like the above, some AI generate a objective for me as 
part of Tech Note Press's roadmap.
