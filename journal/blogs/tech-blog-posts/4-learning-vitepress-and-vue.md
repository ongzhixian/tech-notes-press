# Learning VitePress and Vue

So my first tech post here is naturally about VitePress and Vue. 

Quite honestly, I did not expect to delve in Vue.  
After all, most of working experience is in the .NET ecosystem.

I can't quite recall how I came across VitePress.  
Its probably due from one of those search for document site generators.  

The name caught my attention.  
I had some prior experience with using Vite with Angular.  
And I had used WordPress.  
So my initial curiosity was, "What is this VitePress? Some Vite and WordPress hybrid?"

So I decide to check it out and read that it is a document site generator based on using Vite and Vue.

Now I had always wanted to learn more Vue.  
I dabbled with it to get a feel.  
At the time, my resistance to Vue is similar to Angular.   
I have some experience with it previously, but I couldn't find a suitable framework that I like to work with Vue.  
Plus I was also hung up on the some of the syntax.  
As a result, I never really buy into it.

This time round though, I like what I was seeing with VitePress.  
The syntax does not bother me as much now so that helps my adoption.

All in all, I have to say I am glad to have learnt it.  
I'm sure there are other issues to work on.

For example, I want a simple mechanism that can list out my Markdown posts.  
Unfortunately, there isn't anything like that out of the box.  
So, I am researching how to do that currently.  
Let me get back to it now that I have blog post #1 on Tech Note Press.


<script setup>
// import { useData } from 'vitepress';
// import { getCurrentInstance } from 'vue';
//import fs from 'fs';
//import { glob } from 'node:glob';
//import path from 'path';
//import path from 'node:path';
//import vue from 'vue';
//import { dirname, resolve } from 'node:path';
//import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';
//const { theme, page, frontmatter, dir, site, params } = useData();

//
// const inst = getCurrentInstance()
// console.log('Page loaded.');
// console.log('Relative path', page.value.relativePath);
// console.log('File path', page.value.filePath);
//console.log(fs);
// fs.readdir(testFolder, (err, files) => {
//   files.forEach(file => {
//     console.log(file);
//   });
//debugger;
</script>
